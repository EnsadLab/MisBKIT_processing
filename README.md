## Processing examples

This repository contains some processing examples that can be used with the misBKIT software.
It shows some basic osc messaging in order to retrieve sensor values, trigger animations and controlling motors.

## Dependancies

All examples need the library oscP5.
SensorSimulator needs as well the library controlP5.
In order to add a library under processing, go to Sketch->Import Library...->Add library.

Theses examples had been tested on processing 3.0.1

## Description

animationTrigger is an example that shows how to start, loop and stop an animation based on key inputs.

multipleAnimationTrigger listens to incoming sensor messages and according to the value, trigger animation anim1, anim2 and anim3.

sensorSimulator is used in order to simulate a sensor entry.
